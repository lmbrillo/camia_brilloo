Smart Study Planner: A Python-Powered Time Management Tool for Students

1. Problem Statement

Many students struggle with effective time management due to unorganized study schedules, conflicting deadlines, and a lack of personalized guidance. This project aims to solve this by creating a smart, adaptive study planner that generates personalized schedules, provides intelligent reminders, and automatically adjusts plans based on a student's real-time progress. The entire application, from the front-end to the back-end, will be built exclusively in Python to maintain a unified and simplified technology stack.

2. Core Features

User Management

• Registration & Login: Secure user accounts managed entirely by Python.

• Profile: User details, learning preferences, and academic goals stored and retrieved using Python.

Task and Schedule Management

• Task Input: Add tasks, assignments, and exams with details like subject, due date, estimated completion time, and priority level.

• Automatic Scheduling: A core Python algorithm will generate a daily and weekly study plan based on task priorities, deadlines, and user-defined preferences.

• Manual Adjustments: Allow users to manually modify the generated schedule through a Python-driven interface.

• Deadline Reminders: Python scripts will handle sending notifications for upcoming deadlines and study sessions.

Progress Tracking and AI Integration

• Session Tracking: A built-in timer, controlled by Python, will track actual study time for each task.

• Progress Log: Users can log their progress on tasks, with data stored and processed by Python.

• Adaptive Planning: The central AI feature, a Python-based rules engine, will use logged progress and completed session data to:

• Re-prioritize remaining tasks.

• Adjust the schedule if a task is taking longer than estimated.

• Suggest optimal times for review based on a student's past performance.

3. Technical Stack

• Web Framework: Python, leveraging a full-stack framework like Django or Flask to handle all server-side logic and render the entire front-end user interface using Python's built-in templating engines.

• Database: A Python-friendly SQL database, such as SQLite for development, or PostgreSQL with a Python library like psycopg2 for a more robust production environment. All database interactions will be handled by a Python Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

• AI/Logic: Python will be used for all scheduling algorithms and adaptive planning logic. Libraries like pandas or scikit-learn could be used for more advanced data analysis or simple predictive models if the project scales.

4. Development Milestones

• Phase 1: Core Functionality

• User registration and login.

• Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

• Simple, non-AI schedule generation (e.g., prioritizing tasks by due date).

• Basic UI for viewing the schedule, rendered directly by Python.

• Phase 2: AI Integration

• Implement a study timer to log session duration.

• Develop the core adaptive planning algorithm.

• Integrate progress logging and real-time schedule adjustments.

• Phase 3: Polishing and Analytics

• Build a dashboard with analytics (e.g., total study time per week, subjects studied).

• Refine the user interface and overall user experience.

• Implement a robust notification system.
